# Analysis of companies in the UK using Companies House API 

## Do companies in stereotypically male dominated fields still showcase the same disparities? Can this present an opportunity for change?

Utilising the UK's company house API, 2000 companies were surveyed from four different fields. These were technology, real estate, accounting, and education. These field are currently dominated by males doing the daily work, but change must come from above. If we look deeper into the owners and individuals with significant control companies in these fields, we find a rather un-shocking surprise. From all the companies surveyed the ratio of men to women in positions of power was anywhere from 2:1 to over 7:1 but certainly no field had more females, much less equal number of females in control. This disparity was most evident in the fields of technology and real estate. In the technology industry women make up a mere 13% of the people with 75%-100% ownership.  If we dwell into real estate the figure improves but remains catastrophic representing only 21% of all people in the prior mentioned category. Accounting and education both show significant improvement hence proving it is possible to change. This information should be front and centre for businesses leaders as it presents a clear opportunity for standing for change and opening the doors for women to access these opportunities. Whether banks, incubators, or government this disparity should help guide decisions regarding control and perhaps counteract unrealised biases.

## When's a good time to start a tourism business?

Tourism businesses are amongst the most difficult to maintain. For this reason, I investigate existing tourism businesses to find the best time to start such business. I narrowed a list of companies which are registered as travel agencies, tour operators, tourist guides, holiday centres, youth hostels, and other holiday accommodation. Looking particularly at tourism companies older than average, 6 years, these businesses on average have been running for 16 years. Moreover, the years of birth of these businesses 2010, 2011, 2012 seems to be correlated with periods following crises. If we dive deeper into the place and time of these successful businesses, we find whilst there is a higher concentration in London, unlike failed and other younger active businesses, these are mostly scattered all around small towns likely serving a niche. Moreover, young, and old tourism businesses seem to have in common that the majority are founded in April, July, and August which falls in between the same period most tourism businesses fail. Therefore, based on the success of others, new tourism businesses should register around the middle of the year and if possible, prior to a recession and serve a small town rather than a big city for higher probability of long-term success.

## What is the best place in UK to set up a fintech company? 

Fintech companies have received an unprecedent amount of attention as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic which led to people around the world adopting online financial technologies. With this new-shed light on the sector, there comes increased interest by young and ambitious entrepreneurs interested in starting their own company. By looking into data on registered companies under information technology and consultancy, business and domestic software development, and other SIC codes most frequently found in fintech-related companies we find a clear winner in London as the best place to start a fintech company. Primarily due to the high density of such businesses relative to other cities, for example in our search there were 85 fintech companies founded in London in 2021 followed closely by Cardiff and Manchester with only 3 each. In addition, London has been the hub for fintech for the last 4 years. However, irrespective of location the rate of failure is very high with companies lasting on average between 1-2 years. But if we account for companies founded prior to 2018 the average age was 5 and a half years with 71% still active today. Therefore, the cities picked by 2018 founders would serve as a good proxy for success. Hence, if a different city was to be picked Worthing, Manchester, or Edinburgh should be considered.
